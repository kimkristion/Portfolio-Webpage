# Portfolio Webpage 

## My curated portfolio showcasing my diverse skills and accomplishments

## Description 

- The key motivator for this webpage was to make an easily accessible showcase about me for potential employers to see my work, who I am, and how to contact me.

- My webpage consists of an engaging "about me" section, a captivating showcase of my notable work and the languages used, and a contact me section for easy communication.

- This webpage is thoughtfully designed to provide future employers with a comprehensive understanding of who I am, and why I am an excellent fit for their organization.

- While devloping this webpage I learned to build an entire webpage from scratch.
